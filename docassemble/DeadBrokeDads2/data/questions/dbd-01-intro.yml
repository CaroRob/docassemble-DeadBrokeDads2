question: | 
  Welcome!
subquestion: |
  We can help you fill out the forms you need if:  
  
  * The Department of Revenue Child Support Enforcement (DOR/CSE) sent you a notice that says that you are behind in child support payments. That notice is called a [Notice of Child Support Delinquency](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eFI1jrzWLGSMA094sveue-TOFswCnMcG/view?usp=sharing). 
  * DOR/CSE  took your tax refund.
  * DOR/CSE started taking money out of your pay or is taking more money out of your pay than they should.  
  * DOR/CSE told you or your employer the amount of child support you need to pay is going up by 25%.
  * DOR/CSE froze your bank account so you cannot use the money in your bank.
  * DOR/CSE took money out of your bank account .
  * DOR/CSE took your driver's license or suspended your car registration.
  * DOR/CSE took your business license, your trade license or your professional license.
  * You have another problem with DOR/CSE related to child support.

  ###Note
  
  We **cannot help you change the amount of child support you owe your child’s other parent**. 
  
  If you need to change the amount of the child support order, you will need to go to court. See [Changing a Child Support Order](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/children-and-families/child-support-changing-it) on MassLegalHelp.
  
  We can only help you with one child support order at a time. If you owe back child support to more than one parent, you will need to start over with a new interview for each parent.

question: | 
  Before we get started...
subquestion: |
  You will need your child support payment history. 
  
  If you do not have it, find out how to get it. See [Get your child support payment history](https://www.mass.gov/how-to/get-your-child-support-payment-history) on DOR/CSE's website.
  
  DOR may be able to help you with your back child support informally….they have a number of ways to help before you have to send in forms.    

  Do want to try to fix the problem informally before you fill out forms?

question: |
  this was our old welcome page
subquestion: |
  If DOR/CSE sent you a Notice of Child Support Delinquency you may not have to pay **everything** on the notice. 
  
    They can decide not to charge you:

    * interest, (?)
    * penalties,
    * the amount of child support you owe them.* 

    They can also undo actions they have taken that make it hard for you to pay overdue child support.
    
    We will ask you questions to help you fill out the forms you need to get help with the money DOR says you them.

yesno: get_started
under: |
  Note: Just to be clear -  we can **only** help with money you owe the Department of Revenue. 
  You must still pay any back child support you owe your child's other parent.
