  CR had asked, How can our users actually answer this question? And what if the answer is no?, Barb says 10/07/2020 Ask instead, Is most of the money in this account from your benefits? And also, Do have any income other than your benefits?
question: |
  DOR is taking money from your bank account
subquestion: |
  Did DOR take money from the **same account** your ${ your_past_benefits } benefits are deposited into?

  cs_arrears_date is ${ cs_arrears_date }

  equit_adjust_a is ${equit_adjust_a}

  % for item in your_past_benefits:
    ${ item } : ${ your_past_benefits[item].start_date } --  ${ your_past_benefits[item].end }<br>
